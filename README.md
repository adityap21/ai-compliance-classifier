# AI Compliance Email Classifier 🧠📩

This is a small AI project where I built a model to flag internal emails as:
- ✅ Compliant
- ⚠️ Needs Review
- 🚫 Escalate

### 👀 What this project does:
- I wrote 50+ realistic email examples
- Built a classifier using Python and Random Forest
- Reached 63% accuracy on test data
- Used SHAP to **explain model predictions** (what words affected result)
- Shows how **AI can support compliance in finance**

### 📊 SHAP Example:

### 🔧 Tools used:
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas
- SHAP for interpretability
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🔁 Azure Integration (Future Plan)

This project was built using Python and open tools for simplicity.

But it can easily be adapted using:
- ✅ **Azure OpenAI** for text classification using GPT prompts
- ✅ **Azure Cognitive Services** (Language) to analyze compliance tone
- ✅ **Azure Machine Learning** to train & monitor the model
- ✅ **Azure Blob Storage** to store classified email logs

I’m exploring these tools and preparing for the AI-900 certification.
